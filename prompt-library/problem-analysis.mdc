# Problem Analysis Prompts

Reference these prompts using: `@prompt-library/problem-analysis prompt-name`

## Alternative Perspective Analysis

**Use when:** Need to look at problem from completely different angles

```
take a completely different point of view. start from scratch and look at the problem from all possible ways that could be causing this to happen. now rank those by likelihood. no code just explain it
```
