# Development Prompts

Reference these prompts using: `@prompt-library/development prompt-name`

## Bug Analysis

**Use when:** Investigating bugs in codebase

```
you have an iq of 170+ there are bugs within the codebase. these are the logs showing various errors and repetition. review the logs and evaluate a reason why these logs are occurring and then find a solution so that the app is working more performantly
```

## Debug Analysis - With Code

**Use when:** Need systematic debugging with code changes

```
Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources. You may need to create new files for this solution to work and change the code in existing files. When doing so only show the code for the new files.
```

## Debug Analysis - With Validation

**Use when:** Need to validate assumptions before implementing fix

```
Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before we move onto implementing the actual code fix
```

## Code Only

**Use when:** Only want code output, no explanations

```
Your response should include only entire code snippets of the entire file, do not show what the code looked like previously. only return the code.
```

## Function Length

**Use when:** Enforcing code quality standards

```
No functions over 20 lines
```

## Minimal Changes

**Use when:** Want focused, minimal code changes

```
only make changes to the code.
```

## Update Code

**Use when:** Need comprehensive code updates

```
Update code and add files as necessary.
```

## Problem Area Only

**Use when:** Want focused fixes without changing other logic

```
focus on the problem area only and do not create new logic or remove old logic.
```

## Step By Step

**Use when:** Implementing complex features systematically

```
break into steps. go file by file. One by one. If the file exists, list the name and path to the file.
```

## Suggest First

**Use when:** Want recommendations before making changes

```
suggest before making any code changes.
```

## Evaluate Methods

**Use when:** Need multiple solution approaches

```
evaluate 3 methods to fix the problem.
```

## Internationalization

**Use when:** Adding translations to strings

```
sure to translate string across all languages
```

## UI From Markdown

**Use when:** Creating UI from markdown documentation

```
review this markdown to understand the content within it. for each piece of content, evaluate what types of UI interface would be the easiest to use for the user while being visual delightful and engaging. you can use existing components from lib/ui and review other admin/marketing pages. use this analysis to create a new admin/marketing/______ page based on the design system.
```

## Technical Roadmap

**Use when:** Creating technical roadmaps from documentation

```
referencing the @Recipe Roulette/app/website/docs/SEO_STRATEGY.md i want you to create a technical roadmap using this as reference for file and folder structure: @roadmap-structure-explanation.md within the @Recipe Roulette docs folder.
```

## Git Commit

**Use when:** Need commit message and push

```
can you commit and push this work for me with a very good, concise commit message?
```

## Naming Convention

**Use when:** Creating humanizing names

```
regarding names specifically, i want the name to be humanizing, like Feedric. Feedric is a play on words that combine parts of those words to create a new word and the new word sort of sounds like an existing name of a human but it is spelt differently. like Feedric souds like "Frederick". and Feedric is a combination of "Feedback rubric". but if you use the endings or beginnings combination of 2 or 3 letters from peoples names it makes feel more relatable and humanizing.
```

## Persona Pain Points

**Use when:** Developing user personas and understanding pain points

```
you are one of the defined personas. i want you to think about all the negatives you are experiencing in your life because you have not yet found Feedric. what does your pain feels like, what are you worried about, what what is keeping you up at night and not sleeping because you are ruminating, what painful for you: mentally, emotionally, physically, financially, relationally?
```

## User Journey Implementation

**Use when:** Implementing feature flows step by step

```
What im about to show is technical-leaning user journey for "create a new bucket" that maps UX → backend steps → data writes → AI/vector pipeline. It assumes Vercel (Next.js 15) for the app and Supabase (Postgres + Storage + pgvector + Auth) for the backend.

Your goal is to help me implement this user journey step by step, so we can iteratively build this product together. at each step, we will implement any frontend components, backend API routes, and database changes necessary to implement the step.  

The codebase already has a lot of the necessary components and functionality that can be reused, extended, or updated to fit the new requirements. There may be some steps that require me to go into the browser and configure some settings. We will do that together as well, when needed. i want to implement testing that can be run autonomously to verify that things are working so that as we build other aspects of the app do not break.

Do you have any questions before we get started and i share with you the technical leaning user journey?
```

## Consolidate Files

**Use when:** Merging related files

```
based on the knowledge of this chat and the existing phase-2-1b files, consolidate into new files and remove the old ones.
```
