# Refactoring Prompts

Reference these prompts using: `@prompt-library/refactoring prompt-name`

## Explain Before Proceeding

**Use when:** Want explanation before making refactoring changes

```
explain back to me before proceeding
```

## Separation of Concerns

**Use when:** Looking for refactoring opportunities

```
are there any other separation of concerns opportunities to mimic these benefits? do not go overboard, be selective.
1. Separation of Concerns: Complex logic is now isolated including but not limited to rendering
2. Reusability: The Component can be used in other flows
3. Testability: Much easier to unit test
4. Maintainability: Styling and behavior changes are centralized
5. Readability: The parent page/component is now much cleaner and focused
6. Type Safety: Proper TypeScript interfaces ensure consistency
```

## Iterative Refactoring

**Use when:** Refactoring multiple components systematically

```
lets do each of these one by one, create the folders and files for each
```
